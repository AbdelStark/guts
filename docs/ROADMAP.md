# Guts MVP Roadmap

> Roadmap to a fully working MVP with E2E tests: 3 nodes + 2 collaborating git clients

## MVP Goal

Two git clients collaborating on a Guts-hosted repository:
1. **Client 1**: Creates repo, commits and pushes content
2. **Client 2**: Clones/pulls the repo, commits and pushes new content
3. **Client 1**: Pulls and sees Client 2's changes

All running on a 3-node Guts network with consensus.

## Architecture Overview
